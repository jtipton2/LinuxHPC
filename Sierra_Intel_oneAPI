### Sierra Intel Compile
* For this they recommend Sierra v5.22 as the previous releases would need Intel classic instead of Intel oneAPI.
* They suggest trying to use the Spack packages `intel-oneapi-compilers` and `intel-oneapi-mpi` and `intel-oneapi-mkl`
* Will then need to set the following ENV variables and paths:
    - I_MPI_CC=
    - I_MPI_CXX=
    - I_MPI_F77=
    - I_MPI_F90=
    - MKLROOT= path where mkl is installed and shoudl be a lib directory underneath that path
