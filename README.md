# Sierra Installation on a HPC using Spack

These are my personal notes as I try to learn how to manage a software environment and compile the Sierra simulation suite on a linux HPC.

The new HPC is called "BERNIE" and uses a new headnode, a new file server, and a new Mellanox Infiniband switch.  For now, ITSD have taken 2 compute nodes from the old cluster (node001, node003) and moved them to the new cluster (cnode001, cnode003).  These are older nodes, each with 8 CPUs with Intel _Ivy Bridge_ architecture.  In this way, I can run a benchmark Sierra explicit simulation (i.e. adagio) to compare performance on the same hardware using different verions of Sierra and different compiler environments.

I use a sample explicit problem that is the dynamic propagation of elastic stress waves in a nested sphere in response to a rapid thermal expansion (due to proton pulse heating). It captures the physics and simulation workflow that I need for spallation target development.

The table below shows comparisons with the simulation run for 20 &mu;s:

Headnode | Compute Nodes | Sierra Version | Environment | OFI | Architecture | Time
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
OZ3 | 1 & 3 | v4.56.4 | intel-19.0.3 | | fat_x86 | 900 s
BERNIE | 1 & 3 | v5.14 | gcc-8.5.0 | tcp (IPoIB) | fat_x86 | 1,497 s
BERNIE | 1 & 3 | v5.14 | gcc-10.2.0 | tcp (IPoIB) | fat_x86 | 1,558 s
BERNIE | 1 & 3 | v5.22.1 | oneapi-2024.1.0 | tcp (IPoIB) | fat_x86 | 1,566 s
BERNIE | 1 & 3 | v5.22.1 | oneapi-2024.1.0 | mlx | fat_x86 | 1,415 s
BERNIE | 1 & 3 | v5.22.1 | oneapi-2024.1.0 | mlx | sandybridge | 1,372 s

To try and get a better idea of the impact of communication between nodes, I ran the simulation for 10 &mu;s: with the following results:

Headnode | Compute Nodes | Sierra Version | Environment | OFI | Architecture | Time
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
OZ3 | 4 (8 cpus) | v4.56.4 | intel-19.0.3 | | fat_x86 | 873 s
OZ3 | 4 (4 cpus) & 5 (4 cpus) | v4.56.4 | intel-19.0.3 | | fat_x86 | 869 s
BERNIE | 1 (8 cpus) | v5.22.1 | oneapi-2024.1.0 | mlx | fat_x86 | 1,298 s
BERNIE | 1 (4 cpus) & 3 (4 cpus) | v5.22.1 | oneapi-2024.1.0 | tcp | fat_x86 | 1,348 s

As you can see, performance on the new cluster _using the same compute hardware_ is about 50% slower.  I'm still troubleshooting to understand the source of this slowdown.
