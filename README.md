# Sierra Installation on a HPC using Spack

These are my personal notes as I try to learn how to manage a software environment and compile the Sierra simulation suite on a linux HPC.

The new HPC is called "BERNIE" and uses a new headnode, a new file server, and a new Mellanox Infiniband switch.  For now, ITSD have taken 2 compute nodes from the old cluster (node001, node003) and moved them to the new cluster (cnode001, cnode003).

In this way, I can run a benchmark Sierra explicit simulation to compare performance on the same hardware using different verions of Sierra and different compiler environments.  The table below shows current results.  As you can see, performance on the new cluster _using the same compute hardware_ is about 40% slower.  I'm still troubleshooting my way through understanding (a) if the Infiniband hardware and MPI software are running correctly and (b) how to use the Intel compiler to optimize for the compute node architecture.

Headnode | Compute Nodes | Sierra Version | Environment | OFI | Architecture | Time
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
OZ3 | 1 & 3 | v4.56.4 | intel-19.0.3 | | | 900 s
BERNIE | 1 & 3 | v5.14 | gcc-8.5.0 | | | 1,497 s
BERNIE | 1 & 3 | v5.14 | gcc-10.2.0 | | | 1,558 s
BERNIE | 1 & 3 | v5.22.1 | oneapi-2024.1.0 | tcp | fat_x86 | 1,566 s
BERNIE | 1 & 3 | v5.22.1 | oneapi-2024.1.0 | mlx | fat_x86 | 1,415 s
BERNIE | 1 & 3 | v5.22.1 | oneapi-2024.1.0 | mlx | sandybridge | 1,372 s
